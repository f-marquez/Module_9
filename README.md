# Module_9
Surfs Up Challenge

# Overview
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following:

  **Deliverable 1:** Determine the Summary Statistics for June <br>

  **Deliverable 2:** Determine the Summary Statistics for December <br>

  **Deliverable 3:** A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)<br>

## Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June <br>

   - A working query is written to retrieve the June temperatures from the date column of the Measurement table. 
   - The temperatures are added to a list. 
   - The list of temperatures is converted to a Pandas DataFrame. 
   - Summary statistics are generated for the DataFrame. 

## Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December <br>
![Alt text](https://github.com/f-marquez/Module_9/blob/main/December%20Rain%20Stats.png)

- A working query is written to retrieve the December temperatures from the date column of the Measurement table.
- The temperatures are added to a list. 
- The list of temperatures is converted to a Pandas DataFrame. 
- Summary statistics are generated for the DataFrame.

## Summary
### Deliverable 3: A written report
Overall we saw similar weather in both June and December, although December displays a wider range of weather scenarios. Additional queries we could have run: 
  - ***Precipitation*** -to determine wich month is historically more rain prone <br>
  - ***Weather Station***- to compare conditions at different weather stations.
